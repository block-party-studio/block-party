# Contextualizing NYC Community Districts

Block Party is a platform to explore local policy information, our mission is to make community engagement more accessible and byte-sized. By creating a publicly searchable archive of NYC community board meeting full transcript, highlights and topics. The initiative started in April 2020 as virtual meetings became ubiquitous and community boards adapted by digitizing their meeting recordings on YouTube.

As part of NYC Open Data Week 2022, This presentation will showcase how the data that is created by Block Party's transcript engine can be connected with other sources of public engagement such as New York City 311 service requests. We will contextualize how the two datasets can help inform different perspectives of community challenges, needs, and activities. A comparison between the topics voiced by 311 service requests might relate to what is discussed in community board meetings.
